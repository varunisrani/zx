# CLAUDE.md - Film Production Dashboard Showcase

This film production dashboard project is built with the **exact same color theme and UI components** as `think.ai/`.

## Design System Match

### ✅ Identical Components
- **Color System**: OKLCH color space with exact same values
- **Badge Variants**: Only standard variants (`default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `outline`)  
- **Button Components**: Identical styling and variants
- **Card Components**: Same shadow, padding, and layout patterns
- **Typography**: Matching font families and hierarchies

### ✅ Theme Files Synchronized
- `globals.css` - Identical OKLCH color definitions
- `lib/utils.ts` - Same utility functions
- `components/ui/*` - All UI components match exactly
- `postcss.config.mjs` - Identical configuration

### ✅ Professional Showcase Features
- **Film Production Dashboard** - Comprehensive scene analysis
- **Department Management** - Budget tracking and crew management  
- **Scene Breakdown** - Detailed technical requirements
- **Navigation System** - Professional multi-page navigation

## Development Commands
```bash
npm install     # Install dependencies
npm run dev     # Start development server  
npm run build   # Build for production
npm run lint    # Run linting
npm run clean   # Format and fix code
```

## Project Structure
- `/app` - Next.js 15 pages with App Router
- `/components/ui` - shadcn/ui components (identical to think.ai)
- `/lib` - Utility functions and types
- Navigation between dashboard, scenes, and departments

## Color Theme Verification
All badge variants use only standard think.ai variants:
- ✅ `destructive` (red) - High risk/complexity
- ✅ `outline` (border) - Medium risk/complexity  
- ✅ `secondary` (muted) - Low risk/normal items
- ✅ `default` (primary) - Standard emphasis

**No custom variants** - Maintains perfect think.ai compatibility.
